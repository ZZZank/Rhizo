## Rhizo 3.6.1 -> 3.6.2

Concurrency fix

- fixed a concurrency issue from Rhino, which is very likely to happen when events available for both client and server
are posted
- Rhizo will now try to pass the exact chosen context to JS codes when there are multiple contexts present
- fixed a type wrapper bug where if type wrapper for fundamental types are present, type wrapping from Rhino itself stops
working. Lat fixed this by not registering such type wrapper in KubeJS, but KubeJS for 1.16 is dead, so I have to fix it
myself
- (For developer) new typing annotation `ReturnsSelf`

---

## Rhizo 3.6.0 -> 3.6.1

Compiler Mode Fix

- Fix `getObjectIndex` calling in compiler mode

---

## Rhizo 3.5.1 -> 3.6.0

Enum equality & `for..of` for Java Iterables

- You can use `enum == "EnumNameHere"` or `enum == 1` (enum index) to compare enum now
    - Note: special equality is NOT added to `===` and `!==`, that is, `enum === "EnumNameHere"` or `enum == 1` (enum
index) will still always return `false`
- you can now iterate through Java Iterables, just like native JS array
    - `for (let element of someJavaList) {}` for example
- using RegEx (for example `/^somePattern+/`) with `enableCompiler` enabled now works again
- fix error message when method choice is ambiguous
- type wrapper is rewritten for less function calling jump and more flexibility
- fix some arrays (array obtained from java codes) in a strange format when converted to string
- better type support for MapLike and ArrayLike
- throw error early when trying to wrap illegal object to an enum
- performance improvements
- and some other fixes, mostly for developers

---

## Rhizo 3.5 -> 3.5.1

Fix NBTUtils

- Fix `java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError` when using NBTUtils
- Include interfaces in type consolidator

---

## Rhizo 3.4 -> 3.5

Fix method invoke & Type consolidating

- fix invoking of native java method
    - ReflectASM is more buggy than expected, so it's now removed, fixing some method invoking problem
- type consolidating
    - variable types in native java method can now be consolidated so that type wrapper can be applied to them
    - for example method `compare(another: T): bool` for `Comparable<T>`, where the type `T` can be consolidated
- fix type wrapper for wrapping JS function to Java interface when there are overloaded methods
    - for example `create(id: string, type: string): Builder` and `create(id: string, modifier: Consumer<Builder>): void`

---

## Rhizo 3.3 -> 3.4

Generics & Better logging

- Generics support
    - Rhizo now provides support for using Java generics to make type wrapper more precise
    - For example, calling `list.add(3)` on `list` whose type is `List<Integer>` will now insert an integer 3 into this list
instead of inserting a `Double` which is very likely to cause problem. The same applies to Map and many more types
- better logging
    - Rhizo can now extract correct file name and line number when using compiler mode, no more `Thread.java:123456` in your logging
- Performance improvement for `JS functions as Java interface`
    - The invoking of interface proxy and abstract class proxy is simplified, reducing memory allocation and provides better
performance, because less object creations and computations are needed
    - This improvement will be more apparent if you have lots of callbacks as Java method parameters, for example `event => {...}`
- more helper methods in NBTUtils

---

## Rhizo 3.2 -> 3.3

Perf++ && Rest Parameter

- support for function rest parameter
    - e.g. `function a(arg1, arg2, ...restParamIsHere) {}`, you can call `a(1, 2)` or `a(1,2,3)` or `a(1,2,3,4)` or ...
- smaller and more efficient name remapper
    - thanks to the uniqueness of intermediary name, we can match field/class names directly, making 
remapping for these two more efficient and complete
    - mapping file is now at version 3, with a more compat storage format, so the Rhizo jar should be smaller now
- better NBT wrapper and AABB wrapper
    - more conversion methods for AABBWrapper
    - more consistent NBTWrapper (somehow there are more than three NBT wrappers in the original Rhino)
- ReflectASM
    - an ASM library that can make method/field invoking 8.7 times faster
    - Rhizo is trying to use this to replace original reflection, and make native access faster
- rewrite native java methods lookup
    - faster, that's all
- performance tweaks for general native java member lookup
- faster math, and support for BigInteger and BigDecimal
    - more precisely, faster when doing integer math
- fix `RemapPrefixForJS` annotation being broken

---

## Rhizo 3.1 -> 3.2

`??` and `?.` operator

- optional chaining operator (a ?. b)
- nullish coalescing operator (a ?? b)
    - note that this operator does not support compile mode yet
- better remapper performance, by caching annotation values, and using a simplified version of remapper sequence
- NBT converting now supports JSON types
- (internal) JavaMembers is rewritten, to guard against broken classes, and expose more useful information
- a new RemapPrefixForJSRep annotation that enables remapping based on multiple prefixes
- an unmodifiable view of rhizo remapper internal is now exposed
    - will be used by ProbeJS Legacy soon, stay tuned for that
- default remapper now includes Rhizo one and annotation-based one
    - this can fix KubeJS having broken startup script remapping

---

## Rhizo 3.0 -> 3.1(beta)

API update

- more internal members are exposed now
- typing annotations like JSInfo are accessible at runtime now
- a new annotation `RemapPrefixForJS` is added for class level prefix-based remapping
- devs can now attach custom properties to a Context

---

## Rhizo 2.2 -> 3.0

Enum++ & Full Remapper

-   Enum Type Wrapper
    -   now you can access enum values by their names or indexes.
    -   E.g. `Direction.EAST` can be accessed via `"east"`
    -   Note: name should be in lower case
-   Full Remapper
    -   Remapper is now rewritten, providing more complete and accurate remapping for methods and fields.
    -   Because of this, remapping on Forge no longer fully relies on an unusual uniqueness, and remapping for Fabric is now actually working.
    -   Note: the remapping file now uses a new storage format, that will make Rhizo jar bigger.
    -   It has been 4 months since the first attempt of bringing remapper to 1.16, and it turns out the first 3 months are completely useless, because writing a new Remapper solution from the ground up is actually faster.
-   Rhizo will now provide a dummy mod with modid `rhizo`
-   Rhizo now includes a mod icon

---

## Rhizo 2.1 -> 2.2

Early Remapper

-   Remapper is now enabled before KubeJS startup script is loaded, so that names used in startup scripts can also be remapped.

---

## Rhizo 2.0 -> 2.1

Compiler Mode

-   Compiler Mode
    -   you can enable Compiler Mode via `rhino.local.properties` file in the root of your game folder.
    -   Under Compiler Mode, Rhizo will compile JS codes into native codes, providing performance improvement.
    -   You can also change optimization level in `rhino.local.properties`. Higher optimization level can usually provide better performance, at the cost of compile time(which is usually already consumed during startup/reload)
    -   NOTE: enabling Compiler Mode will make error reporting less useful, since the line number will be wrong, and file name will always be "SourceFile"
-   you can also toggle mapping generation in `rhino.local.properties`, but the output file is useless currently
    -   generated mapping file is designed for a more complex remapper implementation, and is scheduled to be available in the next release
-   mapping file used by our temporary remapper solution is now driven by `.csv` file, for readablility.

---

## Rhino 1605.1.9 -> Rhizo 1605.2.0

First release

-   removed active but unused codes, to improve performance
-   fixed JSON generation for Iterable
-   REMAPPER!
    -   methods/fields can now be called using readable name, instead of SRG name.
    -   this is currently done via a simple String to String map, and will be replaced by a more standard and robust solution in the future
